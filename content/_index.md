# Hi, I am Sai Sandeep
I am a Software Developer from Telangana, India. I like many things related to programming and web. I also enjoy fine arts such as parody music (mostly Weird Al),  Vocaloid music and some Anime.

## Some projects that I did
* [Java result type](https://github.com/ssrangisetti/result-type): Rust\'s result type implemented in Java. Result type and maven plugin which modifies the byte code to enforce the `?`'s equivalent `tryGet()`
* [JsShell](https://github.com/ssrangisetti/jsshell): Simple terminal and shell implemented in Javascript. It is based on <https://uni.xkcd.com> and <https://aava.sh> with some of my own touches

## Ideas that I want to work
* Many Muggu (ముగ్గు) designs are built by combining some fundamental designs. I want to make a website which catalogues fundamental designs and makes designing new ones from the existing designs easier. Something like Excalidraw
* Open source version of REST client like Postman or Bruno. May not be feasible given how many features both of them have, but still would like create one which I can use daily
